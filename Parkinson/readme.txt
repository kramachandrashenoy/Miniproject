 Features Explanation

1. **MDVP:Fo(Hz)**:
   - **Explanation**: This is the fundamental frequency of the voice (also known as pitch). 
   - **Relevance to PD**: Patients with PD may have a reduced range of pitch or altered pitch due to muscle rigidity and reduced motor control.

2. **MDVP:Fhi(Hz)**:
   - **Explanation**: This represents the highest fundamental frequency.
   - **Relevance to PD**: PD can affect the ability to reach higher pitches, so this measurement can show a reduction in vocal range.

3. **MDVP:Flo(Hz)**:
   - **Explanation**: This is the lowest fundamental frequency.
   - **Relevance to PD**: Similar to Fhi, it can show the extent to which the lowest pitch is affected by PD.

4. **MDVP:Jitter(%)**:
   - **Explanation**: This measures the frequency variation from cycle to cycle (short-term perturbations).
   - **Relevance to PD**: Increased jitter indicates instability in the voice frequency, which is common in PD due to muscle control issues.

5. **MDVP:Jitter(Abs)**:
   - **Explanation**: Absolute jitter measures the period-to-period differences in fundamental frequency.
   - **Relevance to PD**: Similar to MDVP:Jitter(%), it reflects vocal instability.

6. **MDVP:RAP**:
   - **Explanation**: Relative Average Perturbation measures short-term variation in the fundamental frequency.
   - **Relevance to PD**: Higher values are indicative of the vocal tremors associated with PD.

7. **MDVP:PPQ**:
   - **Explanation**: Period Perturbation Quotient measures long-term cycle-to-cycle variations in fundamental frequency.
   - **Relevance to PD**: It provides a different view of the vocal frequency stability over a longer period.

8. **Jitter:DDP**:
   - **Explanation**: This is a derivative of absolute jitter, showing differences between consecutive differences.
   - **Relevance to PD**: It is another way to measure vocal instability.

9. **MDVP:Shimmer**:
   - **Explanation**: This measures the amplitude variation from cycle to cycle.
   - **Relevance to PD**: Increased shimmer values indicate amplitude instability, which is common in PD.

10. **MDVP:Shimmer(dB)**:
    - **Explanation**: Shimmer measured in decibels.
    - **Relevance to PD**: Higher shimmer dB values can indicate vocal tremors and weakness in PD.

11. **Shimmer:APQ3**:
    - **Explanation**: Amplitude Perturbation Quotient for 3 periods.
    - **Relevance to PD**: Reflects short-term amplitude variations, indicating vocal instability.

12. **Shimmer:APQ5**:
    - **Explanation**: Amplitude Perturbation Quotient for 5 periods.
    - **Relevance to PD**: Similar to APQ3, but measures over 5 periods.

13. **MDVP:APQ**:
    - **Explanation**: Amplitude Perturbation Quotient.
    - **Relevance to PD**: Another measure of amplitude variation and vocal instability.

14. **Shimmer:DDA**:
    - **Explanation**: Degree of amplitude variation.
    - **Relevance to PD**: Higher values indicate more vocal instability, common in PD.

15. **NHR**:
    - **Explanation**: Noise-to-Harmonics Ratio, measures the amount of noise in the voice.
    - **Relevance to PD**: Increased NHR can indicate a hoarse voice, often seen in PD patients.

16. **HNR**:
    - **Explanation**: Harmonics-to-Noise Ratio, measures the clarity of the voice.
    - **Relevance to PD**: Lower HNR indicates a noisier voice, common in PD due to breathiness and hoarseness.

17. **status**:
    - **Explanation**: The health status of the subject (1 = PD, 0 = healthy).
    - **Relevance to PD**: This is the target variable used in classification tasks to distinguish between PD and healthy subjects.

18. **RPDE**:
    - **Explanation**: Recurrence Period Density Entropy, a non-linear dynamic measure.
    - **Relevance to PD**: Higher values can indicate more irregularities in vocal patterns, associated with PD.

19. **DFA**:
    - **Explanation**: Detrended Fluctuation Analysis, measures the fractal scaling properties of the voice.
    - **Relevance to PD**: Higher values can indicate a more complex voice pattern, which can be affected by PD.

20. **spread1**:
    - **Explanation**: Non-linear measure of voice signal spread.
    - **Relevance to PD**: Measures the variation in frequency, higher values can indicate more voice instability.

21. **spread2**:
    - **Explanation**: Another non-linear measure of voice signal spread.
    - **Relevance to PD**: Similar to spread1, it provides additional insight into voice instability.

22. **D2**:
    - **Explanation**: Correlation dimension, another non-linear measure.
    - **Relevance to PD**: Provides information on the complexity of the voice signal, higher values can indicate more irregularities.

23. **PPE**:
    - **Explanation**: Pitch Period Entropy, measures the entropy of pitch periods.
    - **Relevance to PD**: Higher values can indicate more disorder in the voice pitch, common in PD.
